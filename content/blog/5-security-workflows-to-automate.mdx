# 5 Essential Security Workflows Every Team Should Automate

As security threats evolve and teams remain stretched thin, automation has become essential rather than optional. Here are five workflows that deliver immediate value when automated with ShipSecAI.

## 1. User Offboarding

**The Problem**: When employees leave, their access needs to be revoked across dozens of systems. Manual processes lead to delays and security gaps.

**The Solution**: Automate the entire offboarding sequence:

- Disable Active Directory accounts
- Revoke VPN and network access
- Remove from all group memberships
- Disable Slack and email
- Collect hardware access badges
- Generate compliance report

**Impact**: Reduce offboarding time from 4 hours to 15 minutes while ensuring zero accounts are missed.

## 2. Incident Response Triage

**The Problem**: Security alerts flood in 24/7, but not all require immediate attention. Manual triage wastes analyst time.

**The Solution**: Build intelligent triage workflows:

- Automatically assess alert severity
- Enrich with threat intelligence
- Check against known false positives
- Create tickets for high-priority items
- Notify on-call team for critical alerts
- Archive low-priority alerts with documentation

**Impact**: Reduce alert fatigue by 70% and ensure critical incidents get immediate attention.

## 3. Vendor Risk Assessments

**The Problem**: Evaluating new vendors requires collecting security questionnaires, reviewing certifications, and ongoing monitoring.

**The Solution**: Automate the vendor security review process:

- Send standardized security questionnaires
- Collect and verify SOC 2 reports
- Check compliance certifications
- Schedule quarterly reviews
- Track remediation of any issues
- Maintain vendor risk registry

**Impact**: Process vendor assessments 5x faster while maintaining thorough security reviews.

## 4. Phishing Response

**The Problem**: When users report phishing emails, teams need to quickly investigate and remediate across the organization.

**The Solution**: Create automated phishing response workflows:

- Parse reported email for indicators
- Check email headers and links
- Query threat intelligence services
- Search for similar emails across organization
- Quarantine malicious messages
- Update email filters
- Notify affected users

**Impact**: Respond to phishing attempts in minutes instead of hours, preventing spread.

## 5. Access Reviews and Recertification

**The Problem**: Quarterly access reviews are time-consuming and prone to rubber-stamping.

**The Solution**: Automate the access review cycle:

- Generate access reports for each manager
- Send review requests with deadlines
- Follow up on pending reviews
- Automatically revoke uncertified access
- Document all decisions for compliance
- Generate audit-ready reports

**Impact**: Complete quarterly access reviews in days instead of weeks with full audit trails.

## Getting Started

These five workflows represent just the beginning. Once you automate these core processes, you can expand to:

- Vulnerability management
- Compliance reporting
- Security awareness training
- Asset inventory management
- Patch management workflows

## Measuring Success

Track these metrics to demonstrate automation value:

- **Time Saved**: Hours per week freed up for strategic work
- **Response Time**: How quickly you respond to security events
- **Error Reduction**: Fewer missed steps in critical processes
- **Compliance**: Improved audit outcomes and documentation
- **Team Satisfaction**: Reduced burnout from repetitive tasks

## Conclusion

Security automation isn't about replacing your teamâ€”it's about empowering them to focus on work that requires human judgment and creativity. Start with these five workflows and watch your team's efficiency soar.
