# Getting Started with ShipSecAI

Welcome to ShipSecAI! In this guide, we'll walk you through creating your first security automation workflow without writing a single line of code.

## What is ShipSecAI?

ShipSecAI is your AI Security Copilot - a powerful no-code platform that allows security teams to automate repetitive tasks, connect multiple security tools, and respond to threats faster. Whether you're handling user offboarding, incident response, or compliance checks, ShipSecAI has you covered.

## Your First Workflow

Let's create a simple automation that monitors new users in your system and ensures they have the proper security clearances.

### Step 1: Create a New Workflow

Navigate to your ShipSecAI dashboard and click "Create New Workflow". You'll be greeted with a clean canvas where you can start building.

### Step 2: Add a Trigger

Every workflow starts with a trigger. For this example, we'll use the "New User Created" trigger from your HR system:

1. Click "Add Trigger"
2. Select your HR integration
3. Choose "New User Created" event
4. Configure any filters if needed

### Step 3: Add Actions

Now let's add actions that should happen when a new user is created:

1. **Check Security Clearance Level**
   - Add a condition node
   - Check if user has required clearance

2. **Create Accounts**
   - Add accounts in Active Directory
   - Set up email
   - Configure VPN access

3. **Send Notifications**
   - Notify IT team
   - Send welcome email to new user
   - Log action in audit system

### Step 4: Test Your Workflow

Before going live, always test your workflow:

1. Click "Test Workflow"
2. Use sample data
3. Verify all actions execute correctly
4. Check notifications are sent

## Best Practices

- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic workflows and gradually add complexity
- **Use Templates**: ShipSecAI offers pre-built templates for common scenarios
- **Monitor Performance**: Keep an eye on workflow execution times
- **Regular Reviews**: Audit your workflows quarterly to ensure they're still relevant

## Next Steps

Now that you've created your first workflow, explore these advanced features:

- **Conditional Logic**: Create complex decision trees
- **Custom Integrations**: Connect any tool with webhooks
- **Scheduled Workflows**: Run automations on a schedule
- **Error Handling**: Build robust workflows with proper error handling

## Conclusion

Congratulations on creating your first ShipSecAI automation! This is just the beginning. With ShipSecAI, you can automate countless security tasks and free up your team to focus on what matters most.
